# 🥁 Drum Kit

A fun and interactive project that simulates a drum kit! Users can play drum sounds by either clicking buttons or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard, with added button animations for enhanced user experience.

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated

- **JavaScript Event Handling**:
  - Detecting button clicks and keyboard presses using `addEventListener`.
- **DOM Manipulation**:
  - Adding interactivity by dynamically responding to user inputs.
  - Applying animations to buttons to provide visual feedback.
- **Switch Statements**:
  - Handling multiple input cases efficiently to play the correct sound.
- **Audio in JavaScript**:
  - Using the `Audio` object to play sound files programmatically.
- **CSS Animations via JavaScript**:
  - Dynamically adding and removing CSS classes to create button animations.

## 🛠️ Features

1. **Interactive Sounds**:
   - Play drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing specific keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`).
2. **Button Animations**:
   - Visual feedback through animations when a button is pressed or a corresponding key is triggered.
3. **Seamless User Experience**:
   - Responsive and intuitive interaction through both mouse and keyboard inputs.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Click the Buttons**: Each button corresponds to a drum sound and animates when clicked.
2. **Press Keys**: Keyboard keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) trigger specific drum sounds and animations.
3. **Enjoy!** Experiment with combinations to create your own rhythm.

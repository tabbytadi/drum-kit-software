# 🥁 Drum Kit Program

A fun and interactive project that simulates a drum kit! Users can play drum sounds by either clicking buttons or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard.

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated

- **JavaScript Event Handling**:
  - Detecting button clicks and keyboard presses using `addEventListener`.
- **DOM Manipulation**:
  - Adding interactivity by dynamically responding to user inputs.
- **Switch Statements**:
  - Handling multiple input cases efficiently to play the correct sound.
- **Audio in JavaScript**:
  - Using the `Audio` object to play sound files programmatically.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Click the Buttons**: Each button corresponds to a drum sound.
2. **Press Keys**: Keyboard keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) also trigger specific drum sounds.
3. **Enjoy!** Have fun creating your beats!
